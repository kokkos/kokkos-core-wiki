STL Compatibility Issues
========================

Kokkos developers strive to implement the Kokkos macros in a manner compatible with the latest versions of the C++ language and with the C++ Standard Library (STL). However deviations from this approach occur when necessary, as is the case for the following STL classes (std::*). The STL class does not work properly on GPUs so parallel Kokkos classes have been developed. This section documents the specific deviations and provides usage guidance for developers.
