`Kokkos::Serial` is an [`ExecutionSpace` type](ExecutionSpaceConcept) representing serial execution the CPU.  Except in rare instances, it should not be used directly, but instead should be used generically as an execution space.  For details, see [the documentation on the `ExecutionSpace` concept](ExecutionSpaceConcept).
