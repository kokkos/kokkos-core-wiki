`Kokkos::OpenMPTarget` is an [`ExecutionSpace` type](ExecutionSpaceConcept) representing execution using the target offloading feature of the OpenMP runtime system.  Except in rare instances, it should not be used directly, but instead should be used generically as an execution space.  For details, see [the documentation on the `ExecutionSpace` concept](ExecutionSpaceConcept).
