The concept of a `MemorySpace` is the fundamental abstraction to represent the "where" and the "how" that memory allocation and access takes place in Kokkos.  Most code that uses Kokkos should be written to the *generic concept* of a `MemorySpace` rather than any specific instance.  This page talks practically about how to *use* the common features of memory spaces in Kokkos; for a more formal and theoretical treatment, see [this document](Kokkos-Concepts).

> *Disclaimer*: There is nothing new about the term "concept" in C++; anyone who has ever used templates in C++ has used concepts whether they knew it or not.  Please do not be confused by the word "concept" itself, which is now more often associated with a shiny new C++20 language feature.  Here, "concept" just means "what you're allowed to do with a type that is a template parameter in certain places".

Very Simplest Use: Not at all?
==============================

Just like the concept of an [`ExecutionSpace`](ExecutionSpaceConcept), the first place you'll see `MemorySpace`s used explicitly is "nowhere".  Many of the first things most users learn are "shortcuts" for "use the default memory space for this" which is a type alias (a.k.a., `typedef`) named `Kokkos::DefaultExecutionSpace::memory_space` defined based on build system flags. For instance,

```c++
auto v1 = Kokkos::View<double*>("v1", 42);
```

is actually short for

```c++
auto v1 =
  Kokkos::View<double*,
    Kokkos::DefaultExecutionSpace::array_layout,
    Kokkos::DefaultExecutionSpace::memory_space
  >("v1", 42);
```

(which, in turn, is short for a slightly longer version of this that uses [`Kokkos::Device<>`](Kokkos%3A%3ADevice)).  As with the `ExecutionSpace` concept, advanced users may wish to be generic with respect to the `MemorySpace` that their function operates on; see the analogous section of [this document](ExecutionSpaceConcept) for more discussion.


Functionality
=============

All `MemorySpace` types expose a common set of functionality.  In generic code that uses Kokkos (which is pretty much all user code), you should never use any part of a memory space type that isn't common to all memory space types (otherwise, you risk losing portability of your code).  There are a few expressions guaranteed to be valid for any `MemorySpace` type.  Given a type `MSp` that is a `MemorySpace` type, and an instance of that type `msp`, Kokkos guarantees the following expressions will provide the specified functionality:

---

```c++
msp.name();
```

*Returns:* a value convertible to `const char*` that is guaranteed to be unique to a given `MemorySpace` instance type.

---

```c++
msp.allocate(size);
```

*Effects:* Allocates a buffer of at least `size` bytes using the memory resource that `msp` represents.
*Returns:* a `void*` pointing to the beginning of a buffer that is at least `size` bytes.


---

```c++
msp.deallocate(ptr, size);
```

*Effects:* Frees the buffer starting at `ptr` (of type `void*`) previously allocated with exactly `msp.allocate(size)`.
*Notes:* This must correspond to a previous `allocate` on some instance with equivalent effects to `msp` (see section on default constructibility and copy constructibility below).  The corresponding allocation must occur in a thread whose effects are visible to the caller of `deallocate` (see the discussion of the `fence()` method of the [`ExecutionSpace` concept](ExecutionSpaceConcept)).


---

Additionally, the following type aliases (a.k.a. `typedef`s) will be defined by all memory space types:

* `MSp::execution_space`: the default [`ExecutionSpace`](ExecutionSpaceConcept) to use when constructing objects in memory provided by an instance of `MSp`, or (potentially) when deep copying from or to such memory (see [`deep_copy` documentation](Kokkos%3A%3Adeep_copy) for details).  Kokkos guarantees that `Kokkos::SpaceAccessibility<MSp::execution_space, MSp>::accessible` will be `true` (see [`Kokkos::SpaceAccessibility`](Kokkos%3A%3ASpaceAccessibility)).

Default Constructibility, Copy Constructibility
-----------------------------------------------

Like `ExecutionSpace`, in addition to the above functionality, all `MemorySpace` types in Kokkos are default constructible (you can construct them as `MSp msp()`) and copy constructible (you can construct them as `MSp msp2(msp1)`).  All default constructible instances of a `MemorySpace` type are guaranteed to have equivalent behavior, and all copy constructed instances are guaranteed to have equivalent behavior to the instance they were copied from.

Detection
---------

Kokkos provides the convenience type trait `Kokkos::is_memory_space<T>` which has a `value` compile-time accessible value (usable as `Kokkos::is_memory_space<T>::value`) that is `true` if and only if a type `T` meets the requirements of the `MemorySpace` concept.  Any `MemorySpace` type `T` will also have the expression `Kokkos::is_space<T>::value` evaluate to `true` as a compile-time constant.
