Kokkos is a template-based C++ library that enables the use of thread-scalable parallel patterns for data on many machine architectures.  When Kokkos is integrated into the flow of software programs and compiled for modern GPU-based architectures, improved performance of the computational kernels can be realized. The measurement and expectations of performance benefits from Kokkos integration is based, first on the pre-Kokkos code implementation and then upon the degree to which important kernels have been refactored based on Kokkos best practices; these two different code versions then become the focus of performance testing and further code refactoring.

This document presents a summary of the Kokkos testing activities in its variety and extent. Special focus is given to the components of ‘promotion’ testing, describing the stages of the test process which, upon passing, result in the develop branch of Kokkos (containing the latest set of software improvements and bug fixes) being merged into a tagged Kokkos master and simultaneously into the Trilinos’ repository’s develop branch. Note, Kokkos is a package within Trilinos. This process is woven into and dependent on our chosen repository management software Git [e.g., Pro Git, Chacon & Straub, 2014]. The description of the promotion workflow includes details of the many-step process, including the git commands that are integral to the promotion process.
