# initialize

Defined in header `<Kokkos_Core.hpp>`

Usage: 

```C++
Kokkos::initialize(argc, argv);
Kokkos::initialize(Kokkos::InitializationSettings()  // (since 3.7)
                       .set_disable_warnings(true)
                       .set_num_threads(8)
                       .set_map_device_id_by("random"));
```

Initializes the Kokkos execution environment.
This function must be called before any other Kokkos API functions or
constructors.  There are a small number of exceptions, such as
`Kokkos::is_initialized` and `Kokkos::is_finalized`.
Kokkos can be initialized at most once; subsequent calls are erroneous.

The function has two overloads.
The first one takes the same two parameters as `main()` corresponding to
the command line arguments passed to the program from the environment in which
the program is run.  Kokkos parses the arguments for the flags that it
recognizes.  Whenever a Kokkos flag is seen, it is removed from `argv`, and
`argc` is decremented.
The second one takes a [`Kokkos::InitializationSettings`](InitializationSettings) class object
which allows for programmatic control of arguments.
[`Kokkos::InitializationSettings`](InitializationSettings) is implicitly constructible from the `Kokkos::InitArguments`<sup>deprecated in version 3.7</sup>.

## Interface

```C++
Kokkos::initialize(int& argc, char* argv[]);                 //             (1)
Kokkos::initialize(InitArguments const& arguments);          // (until 3.7) (2)
Kokkos::initialize(InitializationSettings const& settings);  // (since 3.7) (3)
```

### Parameters

* `argc`: Non-negative value, representing the number of command line
  arguments passed to the program.
* `argv`: Pointer to the first element of an array of `argc + 1` pointers,
  of which the last one is null and the previous, if any, point to
  null-terminated multibyte strings that represent the arguments passed to the
  program.
* `arguments`: (deprecated since version 3.7) C-style `struct` object is
  converted to `Kokkos::InitializationSettings` for backward compatibility.
* `settings`: `class` object that contains settings to control the
  initialization of Kokkos.


### Requirements

  * `Kokkos::finalize` must be called after `Kokkos::initialize`.
  * `Kokkos::initialize` generally should be called after `MPI_Init` when Kokkos is initialized within an MPI context.
  * User initiated Kokkos objects cannot be constructed until after `Kokkos::initialize` is called.
  * `Kokkos::initialize` may not be called after a call to `Kokkos::finalize`.

### Semantics

  * After calling `Kokkos::initialize`, `Kokkos::is_initialized()` should return true.

### Example

```C++
#include <Kokkos_Core.hpp>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  Kokkos::initialize(argc, argv);
  {  // scope to ensure that my_view destructor is called before Kokkos::finalize
     Kokkos::View<double*> my_view("my_view", 10);
  }  // scope of my_view ends here
  Kokkos::finalize();
}
```
