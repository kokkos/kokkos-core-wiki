STL Compatibility Issues
========================

Kokkos developers strive to implement the Kokkos macros in a manner compatible with the latest versions of the
C++ language and with the C++ Standard Library (STL). However deviations from this approach occur when necessary,
as is the case for the following STL classes ``(std::*)``. The STL class does not work properly on GPUs so parallel Kokkos
classes have been developed. This section documents the specific deviations and provides usage guidance for developers.
