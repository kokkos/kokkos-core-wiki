Built-in Reducers
=================

`ReducerConcept <builtinreducers/ReducerConcept.html>`__ provides the concept for Reducers.

Reducer objects used in conjunction with `parallel_reduce <parallel-dispatch/parallel_reduce.html>`__

     - Logical 'Or' reduction
   * - `Max <builtinreducers/Max.html>`__
     - Maximum reduction
   * - `MaxLoc <builtinreducers/MaxLoc.html>`__
     - Reduction providing maximum and an associated index
   * - `Min <builtinreducers/Min.html>`__
     - Minimum reduction
   * - `MinLoc <builtinreducers/MinLoc.html>`__
     - Reduction providing minimum and an associated index
   * - `MinMax <builtinreducers/MinMax.html>`__
     - Reduction providing both minimum and maximum
   * - `MinMaxLoc <builtinreducers/MinMaxLoc.html>`__
     - Reduction providing both minimum and maximum and associated indices
