================== ============================================================
|bit_cast|_        reinterpret the object representation of one type as that of another (see note below)
|byteswap|_        reverses the bytes in the given integer value 
|has_single_bit|_  checks if a number is an integral power of two 
|bit_ceil|_        finds the smallest integral power of two not less than the given value
|bit_floor|_       finds the largest integral power of two not greater than the given value
|bit_width|_       finds the smallest number of bits needed to represent the given value
|rotl|_            computes the result of bitwise left-rotation
|rotr|_            computes the result of bitwise right-rotation
|countl_zero|_     counts the number of consecutive 0 bits, starting from the most significant bit
|countl_one|_      counts the number of consecutive 1 bits, starting from the most significant bit
|countr_zero|_     counts the number of consecutive 0 bits, starting from the least significant bit
|countr_one|_      counts the number of consecutive 1 bits, starting from the least significant bit
|popcount|_        counts the number of 1 bits in an unsigned integer

Notes
-----

* For all the above template functions, a non-``constexpr`` counterpart ending
  with the ``*_builtin`` suffix is provided in the ``Kokkos::Experimental::``
  namespace to make up for some compiler intrinsics that cannot appear in
  constant expressions.
* In contrast to its counterpart in the C++ standard library,
  ``Kokkos::bit_cast`` is not usable in constant expressions (not a
  ``constexpr`` function) as it is not implementable as a library facility
  and requires compiler magic which is not available to us.
